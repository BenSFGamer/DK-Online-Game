A project must start with a concept or idea. A vision, you can call it. 

Taking inspiration from the online flash game "Infinite Mario Bros", why not develope a game utilizing the same principle/formula that gave it such endless possiblities? And bring it to the world/series of DK.

This will not be some merely random generated level with no taste or pizzazze (not to make light of the aforwmention game's mechanics), but building off of the concept into something better. More innovative.

In brief, using the same function of level generation, the AI and algorithms would scan and process the samples and data (e.g. given the existing levels from the original trilogy and possibly the fan-made DKC 4: The kongs Returns (being that it is still a ways frpm being finihed we can resort to the original three games)). With machine learning, unique levels could be generated/created with originality and unique twists. From there, we have possibe recursive self-improvement. The end goal would be to offer players with infinite possiblities along with sticking to the nastolgia of what the game served over the years.

Instead of starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel, we could use DKC 2 or 3 as a basis or template for the project. DKC 4 has all the elements from the trilogy as well as new stages and elements excluive to the title, whenever it the game is finished in the near future we could implement it.
